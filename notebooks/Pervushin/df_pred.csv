Journey to Nowhere,Justin Bellamy,2019,"Verse 1:
My heart beats fast when you come my way
My tongue gets dry when i see your face
I can’t help but smile at the sound of your voice
I keep holding on though i know it’s not my choice

Chorus:
Where do i go from here? how can i feel this way again?
What do i do right here? i can’t figure out what’s inside of my head
I thought that i loved you, i thought that you cared
But it seems like i’m on a journey to nowhere

Verse 2:
My thoughts run wild when you aren’t around
The signal unclear like a movie without sound
‘cuz you were my dream, i thought it was destiny
You were my dream, now you’re leaving me

Chorus:
Where do i go from here? how can i feel this way again?
What do i do right here? i can’t figure out what’s inside of my head
I thought that i loved you, i thought that you cared
But it seems like i’m on a journey to nowhere
Bridge:
And oh all the pieces on the ground
Oh i think i get the picture now

Chorus 2:
You never loved me, you never cared
So I’m left on this journey to nowhere
My god, this can’t be fair, i’m on a journey to nowhere",pop
Comin Up for Air,Extreme Music,2016,"I’ve been down here for so long
I think you know it’s true
Swimming with sharks all around

Never Let Me Go,Luther Vandross,1993,"Just let me love you tonight
Forget about tomorrow
My darling, won't you hold me tight
And never let me go

Dry your eyes
No tears, no sorrow
Cling to me with all your might
And never let me go

A million times or more
We said that we'll never, never, never part
Oh, but lately, lately I find
That you're a stranger, stranger in my heart

Give me the right
In summer or in spring time
To tell the world you are mine
And you'll never ever let me go, let me go
Understand it
Give me, give me the right, yeah
In summer or in spring time, yeah
To tell the world
That forever, for always, for love, you'll be mine
And that you'll never never let me go, yeah
Gotta believe it, never never let me go, yeah",rb
Worst Behavior,Teff Hinkson,2013,"I ain't lying though, shit'll get messy
Barcelona colors got my kit ready
Kicking these bars nigga goal post
I been kicking these bars nigga so close
I remember driving, freestyling down the whole coast
White girl sipping iced tea call her Coco
Mushroom pasta from Apropos, feeling like a mobster
Used to work the kitchen down at Pisces stealing lemon tarts with my nigga Sam just to give my ex when she picked me up after
Good Jamaican used to pick me up after
Grew my hair out they mistake me for a Rasta
Seen K the other day and I asked her...Remember?
They used to never wanna hear us, fuckers never loved us
That's why a nigga screaming fuck trust
I been through some dark days I just never fussed up
Friends hit me in the back nigga nun chucks
It's fucked up, I ain't tripping though
I ain't tripping though
Niggas selling out for chump change, Gigolo
Quiet when they see you pillow talking to the bitches though
That's girl behavior, Christian Dior drop curl behavior
Every girl I follow niggas commenting on instagram pics motherfucker that's thirst behavior
Meanwhile she on my dick like a percolator
Remember? Motherfuckers never loves us
Fuckers never loved us, motherfuckers never loved us
Back to my home, they used to never wanna hear us
Motherfuckers never loved us, back to my home
Took a breath see if they could capture my throne
Uhhhh...guess it's back to my throne
They never used to wanna answer my phone
Now you could leave a message after my tone
Ever since I mastered my tone
Every girl trying to Miley Cyrus to my songs
A nigga told me that I fell off...that's a high fucking pedestal
Ever since a nigga dropped 'Starz' I'm a 5 fucking general
Critics always saying they'll try but they never do...Shit!
Get Future on the hook
Haters used to tell me I was stupid should give up
Back when I used to be a student with them books
Now a nigga getting shows out in Europe getting booked
They used to never wanna hear us
This how it feel when you ain't gotta pay for your hotel or the air bus
Leave your ass in the Lair dust...Remember?
I been waiting on December
Still got the juice I just kept it in the blender
Just to remind you it's Island Life bitch doing sand angels in the middle of the winter
Island life bitch, I said it's Island Life bitch
When I was in my old ho, you was in my OLD ho
How old is dem hoes that you fucking man you trying to be me motherfucker man you so close!
So close!",rap
Zombie Zoo,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,2015,"All down the street they're standin' in line
With white lipstick and one thing on their mind
Hey little freak with the lunch pail purse
Underneath the paint, you're just a little girl
Dancin' at the zombie zoo
Dancin' at the zombie zoo
Painted in a corner and all you wanna do
Is dance down at the zombie zoo
Cute little dropout, how come you pack a rod?
Is your mother in a clinic ? Has your father got no job ?
Sometimes you're so impulsive, you shaved off all your hair
You look like Boris Karloff and you don't even care
You're dancin' at the zombie zoo
Dancin' at the zombie zoo
Painted in a corner and all you wanna do is
Dance down at the zombie zoo
She disappears at sunrise
I wonder where she goes until' the night
Comes fallin' down again
You show up with your friends half-alive
Dancin' at the zombie zoo
Dancin' at the zombie zoo
While you can make a big impression or go through life unseen
You might wind up restricted and over seventeen
It's so hard to be careful so easy to be lead
Somewhere beyond the pavement, you'll find the living dead
Dancin' at the zombie zoo
Dancin' at the zombie zoo
Painted in a corner and all she wants to do
Is dance down at the zombie zoo
She disappears at sunrise
I don't know where she goes until' the night
Comes fallin' down again
She shows up with her friends half-alive
Dancin' at the zombie zoo

Resolution Acoustic,Take Cover,2010,"[Chorus]
And when the clock strikes twelve and your lips hit his
I hope you both drop dead from your New Year’s kiss
Make a resolution, remind me to forget you

[Verse 1]
So on this late December evening
Make a toast and take it down
Your vision blurs and you're slurring your words
I'll just smile while you fall to the ground
Let it be known that from this moment
You've been banished from my head

[Pre-Chorus]
So stay out of my way and I'll do the same
Don't want to see your face or hear your name

[Chorus]
And when the clock strikes twelve and your lips hit his
I hope you both drop dead from your New Year’s kiss
Make a resolution, remind me to forget you
I'd rather spend my days and sleep my nights
Without the “should’ve been done” and the “should’ve done right”
I’ll make a resolution, remind me to forget you
It’s time to start moving on
Oh, it’s time to start moving on
[Verse 2]
When you get lonely just keep looking
There's no love left for you here
Keep running it out, keep bringing me down
Only I know what you're really about
Let it be known that from this moment
You've been banished from my head

[Pre-Chorus]
So stay out of my way
And I'll do the same
Don't want to see your face or hear your name

[Chorus]
And when the clock strikes twelve and your lips hit his
I hope you both drop dead from your New Year’s kiss
Make a resolution, remind me to forget you
I'd rather spend my days and sleep my nights
Without the “should’ve been done” and the “should’ve done right”
I’ll make a resolution, remind me to forget you

[Bridge]
Now the ball drops down, my heart drops through the floor
I don't want to taste your lies anymore
Can't move on, can't get over it
Can't move on, can't get over it
Can't move on, can't get over it
Can't move on, can't get over it
[Chorus]
And when the clock strikes twelve and your lips hit his
I hope you both drop dead from your New Year’s kiss
Make a resolution, remind me to forget you
I'd rather spend my days and sleep my nights
Without the “should’ve been done” and the “should’ve done right”
I’ll make a resolution, ‘cause it’s a new year all alone",rock
The Message I Am the Word,Cottonwood Cutups,2018,"You can smell a storm a coming
A war is in the wind
Give safe harbor to your friends and family
As the helter skelter begins

(Chorus)
The message is out so take heed
Bar the door and cover your eyes
The message is out so take heed
Bar the door and run for your life

I am protection from the now
A shield beyond the sign
I am the devil
With a bald head
""X"" scars the establishment

(Chor.)

No conspiracy remains untold
The valley of death, the bottomless pit
Will the son, be the savior?
Or they likely won’t give a shit
(Chor.)

I am the word macabre as true
To my followers, blood begets ink
And I will be your general

How You Know It’s Love,Morningwood,2009,"Are you legit?

Give Me More Love In My Heart,Larnelle,1980,"If I could be all things
To all men everywhere
If I could pray fervently
Pray up that power to spare
And if I had more hope, mm-hmm
Than all those who came before
And could memorize if God be for me
Who could be against me

If I could speak directly
To the mountains of my life
And all could be removed, oh, yeah
Though I speak with all the tongues of man
Of man in a manger
If I could do all those things without love
What would it prove? Oh

Give me more love in my heart
Oh, give me more love in my heart
You got to give me more love
For without Your love, Lord
Where would I be? So lost Lord
Give me more love in my life
Lord I pray, give me more love in my life
So that everything in me can be complete
Though I had the gift of prophecy
To understand all mysteries
And all knowledge
And have all faith, oh yeah
Though I bestow
All the goods to feed the poor
And though I give my body to be burned
It's all in vain, oh...

Give me more love in my heart
Give me more love in my heart
You got to give me more love
For without Your love, Lord
Where would I be? So lost Lord
Give me more love in my life
My prayer is give me more love in my life
So that everything in me can be complete

Give me more love in my heart
Give me more love in my heart
You got to give me more love
For without Your love, Lord
Where would I be? So lost Lord
Give me more love in my life

ETERNITY,STEREOJAEGER,2020,"[Intro]
(""We all get a little scared of things we don't understand
Or can't see
Some of us love the dark, some of us...don't
There's nothing wrong with darkness, but it is often misunderstood
There is some darkness in all of us."")

[Chorus]
Even if the moonlight was shinin' on ya' grave
I would cry, you see
You're all I need
Even if the moonlight was shinin' on my grave
Don't you cry for me
Just lie wit' me
For eternity

Pour it up, pour it up
Pour another one
Fuck me up, fuck me up
I can't feel nothin'
All this liquor in my system got me feelin' numb
I'm just wishin' I was with her
She my only one
Take me back to before it was an act
When we'd kiss and laugh for hours
Now I'll never getchu' back
I can't ever take it back
It's too late for all of that
Now I'm six feet way too deep
With my regret packed in my bags

Even if the moonlight was shinin' on ya' grave

You're all I need
Even if the moonlight was shinin' on my grave

Swear I've had enough
I can't take it, I can't fake it
This is too much
So much pain in ya' name
I can't say it, love
Days change, same thang'
I'm still missin' ya'
Take me back to before you were so sad
I don't know where it went wrong
And how it ended up so bad
I wish I could take it back
But it's way too late for that
'Cause I'm six feet way too deep
With my regrets packed in my bags

Loaded,Seal,2007,"Oh little girl
What have we done
One of us came undone
Which one

Lost in the moment
My despair
Maybe we just don't care
I care

Put it on me
But maybe not this much
It happened with just one touch
The devil in you I trust

Caught it on your face I know it's true

This is not a place for me and you
Every time you look at me

Living in a dream that I wake up
Wondering where I'm going to
But it's true when I do I see you
Loaded like a gun
Oh little girl
Where will we go
One of us got to know
There when I told you so

You let me feel
The place of my regret
Hearing you call my name
Tomorrow lies in pain
Far away

Caught it on your face I know it's true
Every time you look at me
This is not a place for me and you

Wondering where I'm going to

Make me weak (loaded like a gun)
You're like thunder (loaded like a gun)
Skip a beat (loaded like a gun)
How the steel went through me
From a loaded gun
Knowing I could break if you were the only one

I can feel you almost there but it's plain to see
Going down so easily
I want you to look at me
Far away

Caught it on her face I know it's true

It would take a boat
All of the infinitive rope

Anything back to me
Cause I'm old, I will say goodbye
Hoping to run out of my lie
If I get a lot from you
I'll make it all come true",rock

Cause I didn't want you to know
Over my head
Stayed in your bed
Could you check the time?
Your voice starts to sound just like mine

Unfamiliar eyes and brand new faces
I want you but there's no need to be ashamed
If you don't remember my name, that's fine

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause honestly when you asked for lightin'
Said, you look like you're in need of fire, need a fire
I do it all alone, we will get it on
'Cause we both are burning with desire

[Chorus]
Found you in the corner
Lost in [?] but so will life
We could be perfect for tonight
Lean on your shoulder
Kiss on the licker from your lips
Fooling around in life like a kids
Like a magnets, you pull me in
And we begin
[Verse 2]
We were dancing is like you knew me by the way
Took a taxi back to your place all bored

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause honestly when you asked for lightin'
Said, you look like you're in need of fire, need a fire
I do it all alone, we will get it on
'Cause we both are burning with desire

Found you in the corner
Lost in [?] but so will life
We could be perfect for tonight
Lean on your shoulder
Kiss on the licker from your lips

Mr. Tambourine Man,Patti LuPone,2015,"Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

Though I know that evening's empire
Has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand
But still not sleeping

My weariness amazes me
I'm branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's
Too dead for dreaming

Take me on a trip upon your
Magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped
My hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere
I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it

And take me disappearing
Through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time
Far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees
Out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow

Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
With one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate
Driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you",pop
Destiny Calling,James,1998,"So we may be gorgeous

Frame us in a video

Clone us in a test tube
Sell us to the multitude

He likes the the posh one
Cute ones are usually gay

Here we come, this is our destiny calling
We're freaks
This is our destiny calling
Unique
This is our destiny calling now
Don't believe the adverts
Don't believe the experts
Everyone will sell our souls

Get a little wiser
Get a little humble

Tell us when our time's up
Show us how to die well
Show us how to let it all go

It's 106 miles to Chicago, we got a full tank of gas
Half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark and we're wearing sunglasses
Hit it

[Verse 1]
Drop the roof, and let the smoke clear
Double R's are on the seats so ain't no brokes near
You a buster so you hate I'm in the ghost wheel
This is pre, just imagine after post deal
Go from Chicago straight to Cali for a coast meal
I know Meek gon' grab a couple if the coast clear
I get nervous when them goofy‘s get to close here
So I'm persistent with my distance ain't no hoes here
Just a couple niggas who was solid, we don't fold here
And if you dipped out on the tеam, stay gon' then
You wasn't cut out for them gangstas, and the grown men
5P niggas, what the fuck is poor performance?
If you listen closely, count how many times the chrome spits

[Chorus]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
I hit the beat, and I cruise vehicular
Never been man in middle, bruh
I go to Cali, and shake up with bro who be sending the shit I be givin' ya
My homie wear Gucci, work off the cellular
Really ain't shit you can tell to bruh
You'd be a goofy if you tried to set em up
How you gon' prey on the predator
Waiting for you get next to us
Beamer the body, never been pushin' a Lexus truck
I hit the block, then I wet em up
Shorty gon drown in the blood, Latifah I'll set it up
Spinnin' the block, we can set it off
My shit tucked, lotta you niggas ain't weaponed up
Somethin' bout stackin' that cheddar up
Make you look different at niggas who really ain't getting none

And we gettin' that bread (yessir)
We dumpin' that that lead
Yeah, I hit that moves, I know my pictures in the feds
Gravy with the words, I prolly hit fucked her in yo bed
Way too fuckin' grown to have that glitter on my pants

[Verse 3]
But that spitter in my pants, and I'll give her to yo mans
Not the pipe, but the bullets that be kicking out the can
Dump 'em in the water, make that pussy nigga Riverdance
You seen the movie bitch ill do you worst than Killa Cam (Rico!)

I hit the beat, and I cruise vehicular
Never been man in middle, bruh
I go to Cali, and shake up with bro who be sending the shit I be givin' ya

I got this dutch in here, I'm prolly not gon' pass it to a nigga
If it get rough in here, my shorties finna blast it at you niggas

Every drop is for them P's, all the G's know what I'm spittin'
Count, listen

We live in the city, so we gotta ride with the pipe
It's not even grassy, so by this next round
Bitches be knowin' where to hide
Why do you think DP and Meek on my side?
Both of 'em strapped with the heat, gon' ignite
Never gon' argue with Goofy, 'cause from the right angle
Both of y'all lookin' to light
Basically, both all of y'all Goofy's tonight
Said I tell Unc if he be coachin' me right
Now with that beat, I be floatin' it right

I may still regret some moments
But it's just part of a ride
I count myself among the fortunate ones
Who made it to the other side

Lucky for me I didn't go too far
I turned around before the end of the line
